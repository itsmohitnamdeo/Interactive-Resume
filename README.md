# Interactive Resume


## Implementation
My interactive resume utilized the following technologies:
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS

### jQuery
jQuery was used to easily manipulate the Document Object Model(DOM). At specified points within the DOM, as well as on certain key presses, animations are triggered by querying for elements and modifying classes, as well as css attributes.

### JavaScript
JavaScript was used to set timings and intervals for certain animations.

### SASS
SASS was used to separate CSS stylesheets by class, allowing for modularizing of common classes. Variables minimized inconsistencies with color and font styles. Nested CSS rules allowed for more organized CSS files.

### Future
- [ ] Add contact form modal with social links
- [ ] Improve bugs with various window sizes.
- [ ] Incorporate mousewheel/scrolling to movement methods.
- [ ] Make mobile friendly.
- [ ] Improve graphics by improving Photoshop skills or outsourcing asset creation.
- [ ] Migrate project over to custom/minimized jQuery-like library.
- [ ] Refactor
